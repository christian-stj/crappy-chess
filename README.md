This is a chess game developed in Go using the package Ebiten.

It's a simple chess game with all the simple rules. 
Once a player has taken out the king that player wins. This is a small simplification due to lack of time. 
All the correct rules for moving the pieces are implemented.
Graphics are simple and easy. Two players play together on one computer. You control the game by clicking a piece and then clicking the tile you wish to move that piece to.

##### Installation

- [Golang installation](https://golang.org/doc/install)

After that you can clone the repository and navigate to the folder with the terminal.
Once you are in the folder just type "go run *.go" and the game starts.
